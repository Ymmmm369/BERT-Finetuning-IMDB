IMDB Sentiment Analysis - Metrics Summary
=========================================

1. Baseline Model (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
------------------------------------------------
- Accuracy: 0.88
- Precision: ~0.88
- Recall: ~0.88
- F1-score: ~0.88

Notes:
The baseline model performs strongly on the full IMDB dataset, especially for clearly polarized reviews. It relies on TF-IDF features and a linear classifier.

2. BERT Model (bert-base-uncased, reduced subset)
-------------------------------------------------
Training configuration:
- Train / Val / Test sizes: 800 / 200 / 400
- Max sequence length: 64
- Epochs: 1
- Batch size: 4
- Hardware: CPU-only

Test Results:
- Accuracy: 0.815
- Precision: 0.825
- Recall: 0.809
- F1-score: 0.817

Notes:
Due to limited compute, BERT was fine-tuned on a substantially smaller dataset. Despite this, the performance is competitive with the baseline and shows strong contextual understanding.

3. Summary
----------
- Logistic Regression baseline = higher accuracy on full data (0.88)
- BERT (small subset) = strong contextual performance but limited by training size and hardware
- With full dataset + GPU, BERT would likely surpass the baseline significantly
